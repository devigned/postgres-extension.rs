# Postgres Extension

Library to write Postgres extensions in Rust! Overall, the Postgres codebase has some pretty narly C macros **everywhere**, so we have to work around them a little bit.


## Getting Started

This library doesn't make any huge assumptions on the version of Postgres that is needed. Each extension specifies a version of postgres that it's compatible with, such as `90500`. Postgres does some compatibility checks on the shared library before using it.

This library is fully compatible with Cargo! Just include the two crates that are needed (one for the actual library and one for macros) and you'll be good to go!

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[package]

name = "is_zero"
version = "0.0.1"
authors = ["Daniel Fagnan <dnfagnan@gmail.com>, David Justice"]

[lib]
name = "is_zero"
crate-type = ["dylib"]

[dependencies.postgres_extension]
path = "https://github.com/thehydroimpulse/postgres-extension.rs"

[dependencies.postgres_extension_macros]
path = "https://github.com/thehydroimpulse/postgres-extension.rs"
```

## Hello World!

Let's create a simple, "hello world"-like extension.

The first task is to link in the appropriate crates that we need:

```rust
// lib.rs
#![feature(phase)]

extern crate postgres_extension;

#[phase(plugin)]
extern crate postgres_extension_macros;
```

The `phase` feature allows us to specify when to link the specified crate (compile-time? run-time?).

The reason we need two crates is because syntax extensions need to link against `rustc` and `libsyntax`, the Rust compiler and parser (among other things), respectively. These are both fairly big crates and we only have a *compile-time* requirement on them. Meaning, when we run our program (or whatever final output we have) we never ever need access to those compiler crates.

As a result, we'll use the `phase` feature to selectively choose to only link the macro crate during compilation and *not* during runtime.

**Compatibility Checks:**

As I mentioned above, Postgres does compatibility check on the loaded shared library. If these do not match, it won't load. Postgers has it's own `PG_MODULE_MAGIC` *C* macro that handles this automatically. Luckily, we have our own `pg_module!` macro in Rust.

So, continuing from the previous code we wrote:

```rust
// lib.rs
// ...

pg_module!(version: 90500)
```

We're just specifying that this extension is compatible with Postgres 9.5, that's it!

**Exporting Functions:**

Next up is being able to export a function to Postgres. This is done through the `pg_export` attribute that can be placed on any function.

```rust
// lib.rs
// ...

#[pg_export]
pub fn is_zero(a: i32) -> i32 {
  if a == 0 {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return 0;
  }
}
```

**Importing Into Postgres:**

Simply run `psql` (with whatever options you need/want).

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION is_zero(int4) RETURNS Boolean AS '/path/to/target/libis_zero-*.dylib' LANGUAGE c;
```

Replacing the path with the real location to the `dylib`, of course.

Now we can use the extension we just wrote in Rust within a SQL statement. Again in `psql`, we can do:

```sql
select is_zero(1);
```

And you should get something like:

```
postgres=# select is_zero(1);
 is_zero
---------
 f
(1 row)
```
